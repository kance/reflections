- How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

It organized the data in a way that saved a lot of time.

- How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Helps organize work in a way that if there is a doubt you can go back to your older version in an orderly manner.

- What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: you tailor the updates to your personal criteria. 
Cons: you might forget to commit and lose code. 

- Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git is targetted to developers needs.

- How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows the commit history so you can find what you look for.
once you find the target commit you can compare it using git diff to look for errors.

- How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always go back to an earlier unbroken version.

- Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I was not successful in setting up my workspace (color customization did not work out).
I would like to start coding and creating versions to understand the dynamics of the work.
